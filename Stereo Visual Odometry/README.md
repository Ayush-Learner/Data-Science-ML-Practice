# Stereo Visual odometry using Robust inlier selection method

# Introduction
In this project visual odometry is implmented using stereo vision. Stereo Vision data is obtained from KITTI Dataset and can be obtained from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php). In this sequence GPS data is taken as ground truth. This implementtaion is inspired from famous NASA paper and can be accessed from [here](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/publications/Andrew_Howard/howard_iros08_visodom.pdf).
