Random Forest again.ipynb uses PIMA Indians Datset to predict Diabities. It starts with EDA and Feature engineering. Oversampling and under sampling is employed to deal with class imbalalnce datset. Further multiple classifcation algorithm are tried and best one is reported based on F1 score(with reasonable accuracy)
Classification Practice.ipynb used Adult dataset to classify income based on certain attribute. Exhaustive EDA is done follwed by feature engineering. Then Multiple classification algortihm are tried with different sampling techniques, finally best one is reported(XGBoosting) 
TimeSeriesPrediction.ipynb uses pollution dataset to predict pollution based on certain timeseries co-variates. Neural Netweork  based approach using LSTM is taken to predict pollution variable. A comaprison with Multiple time lag is done which results in poor performance then the single time lag one
Vector Quantization-2500 clusters _ simple patches.ipynb,Vector Quantization-1600 clusters _ 10x10 patches.ipynb,mnist_colab.ipynb all three uses MNIST digit data and use different approach to predict outcome based on 28*28 pixel data. The first two uses vector quantization technique to extarct feature out of the image and feed them to traditional classifier like Random Forest and KNN and achiver accuracy around 92%. The third file contains Convolution Neural Netwrok based approach to predict outome of the MNIST Datset and achieves 97% accuracy
