- Bidirectional LSTM is tried to predict pollution level based on other timeseires like temperature, Humidity, Dew etc
- Multiple time lags were tried but single time lag was giving best result.
- .76 MAE is obtained for single lag while for multiple lag(3 lags) 1.76 MAE is obtained.
- Poor MAE can be attributed to overfitting.
